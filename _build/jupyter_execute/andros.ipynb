    "Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is a non-invasive technique in the field of hydrogeophysics that\n",
    "provides structural and electric information about the subsurface. It is based on the physical property\n",
    "known as “resistivity”. Different materials will exhibit different values of resistivity based on their\n",
    "intrinsic capacity to conduct electricity. This contrast is especially strong in coastal aquifers like Andros,\n",
    "where the resistivity values represent the combined rock and water properties – being influenced by\n",
    "both the porosity of the rock and the presence of water with different properties. In addition, ERI can\n",
    "help locate important features like sinkholes and fracture conduits in rocks.\n",
    "For all the above, ERI is used, among other applications, to investigate groundwater, helping to\n",
    "understand the distribution of saline water, freshwater, mixing zones, the geology that controls the\n",
    "flow of subsurface water and provide more insights into hydrogeological parameters (Rubin and\n",
    "Hubbard, 2005). Porosity is one of those fundamental parameters -especially for transport models-\n",
    "because it provides volumetric storage. If supplementary information like pore geometry and\n",
    "heterogeneity is provided, it allows determining parameters such as permeability and hydraulic\n",
    "conductivity that, among others, define the flow in an aquifer (Kazakis et al., 2016). Limitations of ERI\n",
    "are examined by Costall et al. (2020).\n",
    "Examples of the ERI images collected recently on Northern North Andros during Phase II of the project\n",
    "are shown in Figure 8. ERI results are plotted as cross-sections in which the x-axis is the distance of\n",
    "the transect, the y-axis is the depth the survey is reaching, and the color represents the resistivity\n",
    "value measured in Ohm-m. All plots shown in this report represent preliminary images with color\n",
