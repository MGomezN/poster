# Welcome

Hello!

I'm Mariana GÃ³mez-Nicolas



## About my background
I have over ten years of professional experience working in coastal, highly heterogeneous (karstic) environments and I'm currently in the third year of her postgraduate studies at CICESE. My research focuses on utilising near-surface geophysical methods, specifically electrical methods, to enhance our understanding of coastal aquifer hydrology. I have two peer-reviewed papers, including one in Nature. My citation total is 11, and my H-index of 2 (Google Scholar 24/05/23).

## What is innovative about my work?

I consider I have introduced innovative ideas in assessing connectivity in karst systems, employing geophysical methods and tools derived from complex systems, e.g., drawing inspiration from the reliability algorithm for communication networks. I'm consider myself a pioneer in electrical marine resistivity surveys in Mexico.

## My vision
 Embracing interdisciplinary approaches, I recognize that solving significant problems necessitates collaboration across disparate fields. This drives me to actively seek to connect with researchers who share my commitment to producing high-quality tools and applying them to understand complex systems. I believes that open-access software tools represent an essential platform for promoting a fair, diverse, equitable, and inclusive world, and I'm an avid volunteer in professional organisations pursuing those missions.
