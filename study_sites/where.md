# Where?

A set of three geographic zones have been selected that, due to their characteristics, offer
the possibility of studying porosity in coastal karst systems at different scales.

2.2.1 Andros, Bahamas
According to (Cooper et al., 2016), North Andros covers 3250 km2

in the Bahamian Archipelago.
It is a eogenetic karstic aquifer (Vacher y Mylroie, 2002) that comprises Pleistocene deposits

of low-magnesium calcite with minor amounts of aragonite. Posses a high hydraulic conduc-
tivity (See figure 2) due to extensive secondary porosity and permeability at various scales

developed by meteoric dissolution. The epikarst is shallow and present features ranging in

scale from centimeter to decimetre kamanitzas and solution pipes to meter-scale dissolu-
tion pits, locally referred to as “banana holes”. Collapse features including blue holes up

to 300 m diameter and 100 m deep. The vadose zone is very thin (average 0.8 m). The
distribution of freshwater lens thickness is controlled by the size and shape of the island,
effective recharge and aquifer porosity and permeability. Observation boreholes are located
in the study area, facilitating sampling of waters from the top of the freshwater lens. Andros
provides an ideal testbed to deconvolute controls on shallow coastal carbonate aquifer and
correlates with electrical resistivity response because of the dense access on forestry roads
about 200 m spacing to areas with low topographic relief and thin vadose zone.

2.2.2 Puerto Morelos, Yucatan, Mexico
On the other hand, the Yucatan Peninsula is a 165,000 km2

aquifer, discharging huge
amount to water to the ocean (Canul-Macario et al., 2020). It is affected by seawater

intrusion and the hydrological functioning of the aquifer is strongly controlled by karsti-
fication (Bauer-Gottwein et al., 2011). We have selected Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo,

Mexico, in the eastern coastal area because much previous study has been focused (Bed-
dows et al., 2007; Smith, 2001) and where known density and complexity of mixing zones

caves, mapped by cave divers, exist (Smart et al., 2006). Here, an existent electrical resistiv-
ity dataset collected at much higher resolution -in xy plane- compared to Andros, Bahamas

(mean line spacing 50 m) opens the possibility to build up a 3D model of caves over an area
about 1 km2

, allowing evaluate the effect of data resolution on model results and offer-
ing insight into porosity surrounding cave networks. Because of the ecological implications

groundwater discharge may have, specially for reefs, it is important to investigate the degree
to which fresh waters discharge focused within caves or via matrix exchange. It is important
emphasize the data is already collected but there it has not been processed nor interpreted.

2.2.3 Sisal, Yucatan, Mexico
The third place of analysis is located in the northwest area of Yucatan Peninsula, in the
zone that (Perry et al., 1989) reported as a coastal aquitard. According to him, this feature
that has created confining conditions posses this main characteristics: 0.5-1.4 m thickness,

porosity <1%, very low permeability, cemented by calcium-carbonate, age about 23 ky, in-
land extension of 2-20 km, offshore 30-45 km (not experimentally confirmed); and extent

along Yucatan coast of about 250 km. A network of observations wells along the coast and a
numerical model (built based on the porosity equivalent medium simplification) developed

by (Canul-Macario et al., 2020) will be use as the prime source of hydrogeological infor-
mation of the zone. In this place we will have the opportunity to work under condition of

very low porosity and we will include previous analysis of rock properties by (May-Crespo
et al., 2012; González-Gómez et al., 2015) complemented as needed with other petrological
analysis by the laboratory of Dr. Enrique Iñiguez at CEMIE Geo. The results of this analysis
will be of high interest to ecologycal research as it seems coastal aquitard provides ideal
conditions for the develop of endemic species (Carnevali et al., 2016; DUNO DE STEFANO,

2017; Cinco-Castro y Herrera-Silveira, 2020). As was mentioned before, most of the elec-
5

trical resistivity data already exist, but there are some gaps that maybe we can fill with new
data.
